The audit is complete. Here's the summary:

## Iteration 13 — Quality Audit Results

**37 total issues** found across all pages:

| Severity | Count | Key Issues |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **CRITICAL** | 3 | Editor page renders dashboard instead of editor; Both demo viewers (commercial + prospect) are broken — no content loads |
| **HIGH** | 12 | Login page uses tabs instead of unified form; Dashboard has wrong stat cards; Tree view missing detail panel; Analytics tables missing key columns; Command palette has tabs that shouldn't exist; Commercial viewer toolbar design is completely different from mockup |
| **MEDIUM** | 14 | Missing breadcrumbs throughout; Obfuscation still has scope column; Invitation table missing columns; Various text/layout mismatches |
| **LOW** | 8 | Sidebar width, placeholder text, seed data sparsity, footer missing on login |

### Pages that look good:
- **Users page** — OK
- **Update Requests page** — OK  
- **Dashboard collapsed sidebar** — OK
- **Project Detail** — OK (no mockup to compare)

### Most critical fixes needed:
1. **Editor route** is completely non-functional (shows dashboard)
2. **Demo serving** is broken for both commercial and prospect viewers
3. **Login page** needs full redesign (remove tabs, unify form)
4. **Commercial viewer** toolbar needs complete redesign to floating card
