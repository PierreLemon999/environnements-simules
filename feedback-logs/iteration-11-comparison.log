**Progress from iteration 10**: Reduced from 15 issues to 11. All iteration-10 fixes verified as resolved.

**Key remaining issues:**

**HIGH (2):**
1. **Tree view** — Still shows flat list instead of rich grouped folders with page detail panel, breadcrumb, and action buttons (per mockup R001-R003)
2. (part of tree) — Missing page detail right panel with metadata, links, health, obfuscation rules, and guides

**MEDIUM (5):**
3. Sidebar collapse screenshot appears identical to expanded (test issue)
4. Tree view missing "Par site" / "Par guide" sub-tabs
5. Analytics splits sessions into Admins/Clients panels — mockup shows single "Sessions récentes" list
6. Dashboard stat card left-border style differs from mockup (minor)
7. Command palette still shows quick actions rather than real search results with rich metadata

**LOW (4):**
8-9. Obfuscation extras beyond mockup (acceptable)
10. Analytics missing "Exporter CSV" button
11. Missing screenshot tests for editor, demo viewer, commercial viewer
