The iteration 8 audit is complete. Here's the summary:

## Iteration 8 Results: 17 issues (0 CRITICAL, 5 HIGH, 7 MEDIUM, 5 LOW)

**Major progress since iteration 7** — 6 issues resolved:
- Search bar, "+ Nouveau projet" button, bar charts, Composants nav item, unicode encoding, and [object Object] preview all fixed

**Remaining HIGH issues (5):**
1. **Login — stale old screenshots** coexist with new correct design (test artifact)
2. **Dashboard — sidebar collapse** not working in tests (05-dashboard-collapsed identical to expanded)
3. **Tree view — missing page detail panel** (right panel still placeholder)
4. **Sidebar — collapse never triggers** across all 14 screenshots
5. (Sidebar collapse counted as cross-cutting)

**Key MEDIUM issues (7):**
- Dashboard stat cards still have orange top borders (mockup shows clean white)
- Tree view "Par guide" and "Carte du site" tabs may be unimplemented
- Analytics missing session detail side panel
- Obfuscation résultat shows raw JSON instead of formatted HTML
- Invitations form always visible (minor UX)
- Command palette should prioritize page results over actions
