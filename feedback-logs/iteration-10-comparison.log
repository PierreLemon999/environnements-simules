Report written to `feedback-logs/iteration-10-issues.md`. Here's the summary:

## Iteration 10 QA Results

**0 CRITICAL** | **3 HIGH** | **7 MEDIUM** | **5 LOW** = **15 total issues**

Down from 19 issues in iteration 9 (with 1 CRITICAL), and no more critical blockers.

### HIGH issues (3):
1. **Dashboard stat cards** — "Démos actives" and "Sessions ce mois" should be "Pages consultées" and "Temps passé" per mockup feedback R009
2. **Tree view structure** — Still a flat list, mockup shows collapsible folder groups with page counts, colored icons, modal badges, and overflow links
3. **Obfuscation "Portée" column** — Should be removed since scope is always "Global" per R001 feedback

### MEDIUM issues (7):
- Login narrow viewport in first screenshots (test config issue)
- Dashboard "767min moy." unrealistic session duration
- Dashboard bar chart sparse data (seed data)
- Projects breadcrumb polish
- Tree view missing "Carte du site" graph visualization
- Command palette is a modal but mockup shows full search results page
- Project detail health ring edge case validation

### Pages OK:
Login (admin tab), Login (error), Dashboard (collapsed), Invitations, Users, Update Requests, Sidebar, Global Header

### Not tested:
Page Editor, Demo Viewer, Commercial Viewer — no screenshots captured for these routes.
