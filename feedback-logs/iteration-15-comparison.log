| HIGH | 2 |
| MEDIUM | 4 |
| LOW | 4 |
| **TOTAL** | **10** |

All 3 CRITICAL issues from iteration 14 are now resolved (editor loads, demo viewers show content, login branding fixed). The remaining issues are:

**HIGH (2):**
1. Two conflicting login page designs still appear in test screenshots (stale tab-based version alongside the correct single-form version)
2. Editor screenshot is too small/compressed to fully validate against mockup

**MEDIUM (4):**
3. Tree view missing collapsible section headers with page counts per the mockup
4. Analytics company column shows dashes instead of actual company names (R005 unresolved feedback)
5. Command palette category tab names differ slightly from mockup
6. Demo viewer "LL" widget positioned at top-center instead of bottom-right

**LOW (4):**
7. Login background gradient style slightly differs from mockup
8. Tree view footer breadcrumb format differs
9. Dashboard has 4 stat cards vs mockup's 2 (enhancement, not regression)
10. Commercial viewer missing admin toolbar overlay from mockup

The app has improved significantly from iteration 14. No blocking issues remain.
