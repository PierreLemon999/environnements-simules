The iteration 5 quality audit is complete. Here's the summary:

**Iteration 5 Results: 14 issues (down from 26 in iteration 4)**

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 0 |
| HIGH | 3 |
| MEDIUM | 6 |
| LOW | 5 |

**Key findings:**

- **All 26 iteration-4 issues were addressed** (error messages in French, pill tabs, background shape, breadcrumbs, analytics split, etc.)
- **3 HIGH issues remain:**
  1. Dashboard missing compact bar chart between stats and activity log (per mockup)
  2. Tree view visual richness gap — all dots same color, no category-colored icons
  3. Tree view detail panel needs verification when page selected
- **Notable MEDIUM issues:** anonymous session company name display (unresolved mockup feedback), obfuscation tab pill styling mismatch, project detail missing tab navigation for assignations/configuration
- **4 unresolved mockup-forge feedback items** tracked — 3 appear already resolved in code, 1 (analytics company name) still needs work
