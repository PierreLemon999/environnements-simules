Report written to `feedback-logs/iteration-2-issues.md`.

**Summary of findings:**

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 1 |
| HIGH | 12 |
| MEDIUM | 10 |
| LOW | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **29** |

**Key findings:**

- **CRITICAL**: Dashboard shows `-483m -59s` negative duration — data formatting bug
- **HIGH (login)**: Screenshots 02/03 still show the OLD tab-based login UI (the new unified design in screenshot 01 looks correct)
- **HIGH (dashboard)**: Layout fundamentally differs from mockup — has a project list table that shouldn't be there, and the activity log is too simple compared to the mockup's detailed table
- **HIGH (sidebar)**: Missing badge counts (Projets 7, Analytics 24, etc.), missing tool page counts, and missing "Composants" nav item
- **HIGH (project detail)**: UUID shown in breadcrumb instead of project name
- **HIGH (tree view)**: Missing "Carte du site" (site map) tab, simpler tree structure than mockup
- **HIGH (analytics)**: Different layout from mockup, missing date range picker
- **MEDIUM**: Various styling differences (obfuscation columns, command palette counts, invitations button label, login background tint)
- **LOW**: Polish items (hover effects, collapsed sidebar cleanup, online status dot)

The login page rewrite (screenshot 01) looks very good and close to the mockup. The major remaining work is on the dashboard layout, sidebar enrichment, and tree/analytics pages.
