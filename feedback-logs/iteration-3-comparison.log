Audit complete. The report has been written to `feedback-logs/iteration-3-issues.md`.

**Summary of findings: 29 issues total**

| Severity | Count | Key highlights |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | 2 | Analytics shows "-30093s" for average duration; Login may serve old design |
| **HIGH** | 9 | Dashboard layout differs from mockup; Tree view missing detail panel + graph view; Obfuscation missing TYPE column; Analytics layout differences |
| **MEDIUM** | 12 | UPPERCASE stat labels everywhere (should be sentence case); Command palette doesn't search pages; Duplicate buttons on projects; Wrong button label on invitations; Extra "Composants" sidebar item |
| **LOW** | 6 | Breadcrumb inconsistencies; Users page OK; Update requests OK |

**Top priorities to fix:**
1. Fix the analytics negative duration bug (data computation error)
2. Confirm only the new tabbed login design is served
3. Implement the tree view right detail panel (biggest feature gap)
4. Change all stat card labels from UPPERCASE to sentence case
5. Add page search to the command palette
