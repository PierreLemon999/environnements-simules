Audit complete. Here's the summary:

**Report written to**: `feedback-logs/iteration-1-issues.md`

## Key Findings

**TOTAL: 19 issues** (2 CRITICAL, 8 HIGH, 6 MEDIUM, 3 LOW)

### The big problem: 11 of 14 screenshots show the login page
The auth guard in `admin/+layout.ts` checks `isAuthenticated` synchronously before `loadFromStorage()` completes in the root layout's async `onMount`. This race condition causes every `/admin/*` route to redirect to `/login`. Combined with the test harness silently swallowing the failed Google SSO mock login, **all admin page screenshots are just the login page**.

### Login page (the only page actually rendered) has 17 issues vs mockup:
- **Wrong structure**: App uses tabs (client/admin), mockup shows unified single-page form
- **Wrong branding**: "ES" / "Environnements Simulés" vs mockup's "ED" / "Environnements de Démonstration"  
- **8+ missing elements**: password toggle, remember-me, forgot password link, section label, divider, footer, animated background, dot pattern
- **Wrong Google icon**: Generic Chrome icon vs multicolor Google "G" logo
- **Color mismatch**: #3B82F6 vs mockup's #2563eb

### Next steps:
1. Fix the auth guard race condition (CRITICAL)
2. Fix the test harness to actually authenticate (CRITICAL)  
3. Rewrite the login page to match the mockup
4. Re-run screenshots and perform a second audit of all admin pages
