Report written to `feedback-logs/iteration-12-issues.md`.

**Summary of findings:**

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 4 |
| HIGH | 14 |
| MEDIUM | 13 |
| LOW | 8 |
| **TOTAL** | **39** |

The high issue count is primarily due to **3 newly-tested pages** (Editor, Demo Viewer, Commercial Viewer) that were not captured in previous iterations:

**CRITICAL issues (fix first):**
1. **Demo Viewer** — "Page introuvable", content doesn't load (backend empty path handling + hardcoded `localhost:3001` URL)
2. **Prospect Viewer** — Completely blank white page (same root cause)
3. **Editor** — Doesn't render at all, shows dashboard instead (route/API failure)

**Key HIGH issues:**
- Invitations: `requireAccount` checkbox value never sent to backend (1-line fix)
- Invitations: Missing "2 ans" expiry option in link-sharing (1-line fix)
- Analytics: Should show two side-by-side tables (Admins/Clients), not unified list (mockup R005 confirms this)
- Analytics: Should have 3 separate stat cards, not 1 combined
- Tree View: Missing rich detail panel with preview, sub-tabs, metadata
- Tree View: Missing resizable panel handle (R002 feedback)
- Editor: Missing JavaScript tab, breadcrumb, tree sidebar

**Pages that are OK:** Login, Projects, Project Detail (mostly), Users, Obfuscation, Update Requests.
