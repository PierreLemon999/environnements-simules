Phase 8 review is complete. Here's the summary:

**Backend:** All 5 CRUD endpoints verified working (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, preview) — no changes needed.

**Frontend:** 11 issues found and fixed on `/admin/obfuscation`:
- **1 critical:** Animation reactive dependency loop causing erratic counter values — fixed by tracking previous targets in non-reactive variables
- **4 major:** Table column structure, inactive row dimming, action button visibility, stats footer placement
- **6 minor:** Toggle styling, coverage bar gradient, replace term color, dynamic card title, section text/icon, occurrences icon

**3 remaining low-priority items:** Drag-and-drop ordering (needs schema migration), rich visual CRM preview (works functionally with textarea), test selector fragility (test-only issue).

Report written to `review-logs/phase-8-report.md`. Temp test files cleaned up.
