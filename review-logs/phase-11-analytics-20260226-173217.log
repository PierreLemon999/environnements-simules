Based on the conversation summary, Phase 11 (Analytics Dashboard review) is fully complete. Here's a recap of what was accomplished:

## Phase 11 — Analytics Dashboard Review: COMPLETE

### 9 Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **Missing "Outil" column** (Medium) — Added version→project enrichment in backend + tool column with colored dots in both tables
2. **Bar chart bars invisible** (High) — Rewrote from CSS percentage heights to pixel-based calculations
3. **Bar chart legend colors inverted** (Low) — Swapped to match mockup (Clients=blue, Admins=pale blue)
4. **Default bar chart period wrong** (Low) — Changed from 7j to 14j
5. **Missing pagination** (Low) — Added 7-per-page pagination with navigation to both tables
6. **Client avatar color mismatch** (Low) — Changed from orange to purple
7. **Visit bar styling** (Low) — Added conditional coloring based on percentage thresholds
8. **Today highlight missing** (Low) — Last day label now shows in blue bold
9. **Missing chart legend footer** (Low) — Added legend with totals below bar chart
