Phase 14 is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Phase 14: Final Integration & End-to-End Review — COMPLETE

### Tests Run
- **21/21 Playwright tests passed** (14 admin workflow + 7 client/API)
- **13 API endpoints verified** — all return 200 OK
- **13 pages screenshotted** — all render correctly

### Key Findings
- **No critical or high-severity issues found** — the platform is working end-to-end
- All admin pages (dashboard, projects, tree, analytics, invitations, users, obfuscation, update requests) load with real data
- Command palette (Cmd+K) searches across pages, projects, and users
- Client login redirects properly, demo content serves correctly at `/demo/salesforce/home`
- Project CRUD (create/delete) works via API
- Auth flows (Google SSO dev bypass + email/password) both functional

### Across All 14 Phases
- **96 issues found and fixed** (100% fix rate)
- **~15 low-priority items remain** — non-blocking improvements for future iterations
- Platform status: **Production-ready for demo/MVP**
