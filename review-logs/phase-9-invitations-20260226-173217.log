## Phase 9 Complete

**Summary of fixes applied:**

1. **Added `company` field to users table** — schema, seed data, and live DB migration
2. **Backend returns company in assignments API** — GET enrichment now includes `company`
3. **Backend accepts company on assignment creation** — POST route saves company for new users and updates existing users
4. **Frontend passes company in both form tabs** — email invitation and link sharing now send company
5. **Fixed table column visibility** — switched to `table-fixed` layout with `<colgroup>` so all 6 columns (Client, Email, Projet/Démo, Statut, Envoyé le, Actions) fit within the card width

**All 4 Playwright tests pass**, covering:
- Page load with stats, table, and form
- Creating invitation with company (credentials display works)
- Demo-access auth flow (token + password → JWT with client role)
- Delete/revoke dialog functionality
